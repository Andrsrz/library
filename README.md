  * To have a persistent user settings. Kind of a database.
* [JSON parsing](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/json).
  * Very handy to work with objects and arrays.
* [Asyn Calls](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/async).

  web It wasn't cleaning faster enogh so I add it to wait until the library is
  clean.
